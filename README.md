# Shoe-Store-Website

This website was created by following a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-2Pj5hxwrw&list=WL&index=4). I used it to learn basic HTML/CSS/Bootstrap techniques and practice coding. All credit for the original layout/design goes to the tutorial creator. I completed it as a learning exercise and can now build similar projects on my own.
